# -Advertising-Sales-Prediction
Objective:
Designed to predict sales based on advertising budgets across various channels, including digital communications (television, radio) and print communications (newspapers).
The underlying goal is to provide users with a tool that can help them make informed decisions about budget allocations for different advertising channels.

Technology Stack:
Python: The programming language used for the application's development.
Machine Learning: Implemented a linear regression model for predicting sales. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome based on one or more predictor variables.
Streamlit: This is a web application framework for Python that allows you to create interactive and user-friendly web applications for data science and machine learning.

Data Source:
Historical advertising data is used to train the linear regression model. This data likely includes information on past advertising budgets and corresponding sales figures.

User Interface (UI):
Streamlit Interface: Users interact with the application through a Streamlit interface, which is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
Budget Input:
Users can input their budgetary allocations for each advertising channel. This likely involves specifying how much they plan to spend on television, radio, and newspaper advertising.
Prediction Output:
The application generates accurate sales predictions based on the user-inputted budget allocations. This information is crucial for businesses to optimize their advertising strategies.

Enhanced Features:
Accurate Predictions: The linear regression model, trained on historical data, provides accurate sales predictions. This enhances the reliability of the application and aids users in making informed decisions.
Budget Allocation Guidance: Users receive guidance on how to allocate their budget effectively across different advertising channels to maximize sales.

User Benefits:
Informed Decision-Making: The application empowers users to make informed decisions about their advertising strategies by providing predictions tailored to their budget allocations.
Optimized Budgeting: Users can optimize their budgeting by understanding the expected impact of various advertising channels on sales.
